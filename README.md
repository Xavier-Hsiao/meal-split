## State management

The `friends` and `selectedFriend`state is defined in the `App` component instead of `FriendList` or `Friend`component. This decision is related to the requirement of data sharing .

The benefits of _lifting up state_ are:

1. **Single source of truth:** The state in the parent component (`App`) serves as a single source of truth for the open item index, centralizing the data of friends of and ensures that all child components have access to the same state value.

2. **Consistency and synchronization:**
   Sharing the same state instead of having its own state allows child components to coordinate.

3. **Ease of control:**
   By placing the state in the parent component, the parent can implement additional logic if needed, all management in one place.

4. **Efficiency:**
   Changing state at higher levels in the component tree can lead to optimized re-rendering in React.
